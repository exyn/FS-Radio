# FS-Radio
This will be a module inspired by the radio in the F/A-18C with buttons, segment displays etc. for use with simulators like DCS.<br>
First thought is to follow more or less the same work pattern as with the "FS-MFD" also available. Something we are exploring though is to
possibly use aluminium for at least the front part to make it look better. Likely we will start with a 3D-printable version first though.<br><br>
There is no real ETA right now but the schematic and PCB part of the work is where I'll start. The idea would be to have everything available on this unit as to not have to map anything else to handle the radio. Together with the MFD:s when using VR we're thinking this would be a nice addition. If you have any suggestions, send me an e-mail at gustaf.lindstroem@gmail.com!
